### What is [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)?

- [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol.
- Developed by [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/).
- SSH uses a ```client-server model```, which means that your machine is the client, and the machine you are connecting to is the server.

- If you are on an up-to-date operating system from the last five years, you probably have SSH installed.
- Many modern operating systems, including popular Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian), macOS, and even some Windows distributions, come with SSH pre-installed or have easy ways to install it.
